# Spec: String Reverse Utility

**Spec ID:** 02-string-reverse-utility
**Status:** implemented
**Created:** 2026-04-24
**Depends on:** none

## What it does

A minimal string-reversal utility implemented in both Python (backend) and TypeScript (frontend), plus a dev-only FastAPI route that exposes the backend function over HTTP. This feature exists primarily to validate the full project scaffold: that tests run, linters pass, and the route layer correctly calls into `backend/lib/`. It is a smoke test for the development workflow, not a user-facing product feature.

## User-facing behavior

No end-user interaction. The calling code sees:

- **Python:** a pure function importable from `backend/lib/utils.py`.
- **TypeScript:** a pure function importable from `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts`.
- **HTTP:** a `POST /dev/reverse-string` endpoint that accepts a JSON body and returns a JSON response. This route is clearly marked as a dev/test endpoint and should not be included in production API documentation.

## Inputs and outputs

### Python function — `reverse_string`

**Input:**
- `s: str` — the string to reverse.

**Output:**
- `str` — the reversed string.

**Errors:**
- `TypeError` — raised if `s` is not a `str` (including `None`).

### TypeScript function — `reverseString`

**Input:**
- `s: string` — the string to reverse. TypeScript's type system prevents `null`/`undefined` at compile time; no runtime guard needed.

**Output:**
- `string` — the reversed string.

**Errors:**
- N/A — TypeScript type system enforces input type at compile time.

### HTTP route — `POST /dev/reverse-string`

**Request body (JSON):**
- `input: string` — the string to reverse.

**Response body (JSON):**
- `result: string` — the reversed string.

**Errors:**
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — FastAPI default when request body is malformed or `input` is missing.
- `400 Bad Request` — if `input` value is not a string type (e.g. a number passed in JSON).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Given `s = "hello"`, when `reverse_string("hello")` is called, then it returns `"olleh"`.
- [ ] Given `s = ""`, when `reverse_string("")` is called, then it returns `""`.
- [ ] Given a string containing Unicode characters (e.g. `"café"`), when `reverse_string` is called, then it reverses by codepoint (standard Python string indexing behavior), returning `"éfac"`.
- [ ] Given `s = None`, when `reverse_string(None)` is called, then it raises `TypeError`.
- [ ] Given `s = 42`, when `reverse_string(42)` is called, then it raises `TypeError`.
- [ ] Given `s = "hello"`, when `reverseString("hello")` is called in TypeScript, then it returns `"olleh"`.
- [ ] Given `s = ""`, when `reverseString("")` is called in TypeScript, then it returns `""`.
- [ ] Given a string containing Unicode characters (e.g. `"café"`), when `reverseString` is called, then it reverses by codepoint, returning `"éfac"`.
- [ ] Given a valid JSON body `{"input": "hello"}`, when `POST /dev/reverse-string` is called, then the response is `200 OK` with body `{"result": "olleh"}`.
- [ ] Given a JSON body `{"input": ""}`, when `POST /dev/reverse-string` is called, then the response is `200 OK` with body `{"result": ""}`.
- [ ] Given a malformed JSON body or missing `input` field, when `POST /dev/reverse-string` is called, then the response is `422 Unprocessable Entity`.
- [ ] `uv run pytest` passes with all tests green.
- [ ] `uv run ruff check . && uv run black --check .` exits 0.
- [ ] `pnpm test` (Vitest) passes with all tests green.
- [ ] `pnpm lint` (ESLint) exits 0.

## Out of scope

- Grapheme cluster-aware reversal (e.g. emoji sequences, combining characters). Standard codepoint reversal only.
- Any frontend UI or user-visible component.
- Authentication or authorization on the `/dev/reverse-string` route.
- Rate limiting or any production hardening of the dev route.
- Reversing non-string types (arrays, buffers, etc.).

## Technical approach

- **Python:** Single function in `backend/lib/utils.py` using slice syntax (`s[::-1]`). Raise `TypeError` with a descriptive message if `isinstance(s, str)` is false.
- **TypeScript:** Single function in `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` using `.split("").reverse().join("")`. No runtime type guard.
- **Route:** Thin FastAPI handler in `backend/routes/dev.py`. Define a Pydantic request model with `input: str`. Call `reverse_string` from `backend/lib/utils`. Return a Pydantic response model with `result: str`. Register the router under `/dev` prefix in `backend/main.py`.

## Dependencies

- External libraries: none beyond what the scaffold already includes (FastAPI, Pydantic, pytest, ruff, black, Vitest, ESLint).
- Other specs that must be implemented first: none.
- External services: none.

## Testing approach

- **Python unit tests** in `backend/tests/test_utils.py`: happy path, empty string, Unicode, `None` input, non-string input.
- **Python integration test** in `backend/tests/test_dev_routes.py`: use FastAPI `TestClient` to exercise `POST /dev/reverse-string` with valid input, empty string, and malformed body.
- **TypeScript unit tests** in `frontend/src/lib/utils.test.ts` (Vitest): happy path, empty string, Unicode.
- **Manual verification:** run `uv run uvicorn main:app --reload` and hit the endpoint with `curl` to confirm the route is wired end-to-end.

## Open questions

None. All decisions resolved in interview.

## Implementation notes

**What was implemented:**

- `backend/lib/utils.py` — `reverse_string(s: str) -> str` using `s[::-1]`. Raises `TypeError` for non-str input with a descriptive message.
- `backend/routes/dev.py` — thin FastAPI router for `POST /dev/reverse-string`. Uses Pydantic `ConfigDict(strict=True)` so numeric JSON values for `input` are rejected with 422 (not silently coerced).
- `backend/main.py` — minimal FastAPI app entry point that registers the dev router under `/dev`.
- `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` — `reverseString(s: string): string` using `.split("").reverse().join("")`.
- `frontend/src/lib/utils.test.ts` — Vitest unit tests (5 cases).
- `backend/tests/test_utils.py` — 9 pytest unit tests covering happy path, Unicode, and TypeError cases.
- `backend/tests/test_dev_routes.py` — 7 FastAPI TestClient integration tests.
- `backend/conftest.py` — adds `backend/` to `sys.path` so tests can import `lib.*` and `main` by bare name.
- `backend/pyproject.toml` — added `pythonpath = ["."]` to `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` (belt-and-suspenders alongside conftest).

**Deviations from spec:**

- The scaffold had created a directory named literally `{routes,lib` (a failed brace expansion). This artefact was left in place (not deleted) since it's harmless and touching it wasn't in scope. The real `lib/` and `routes/` directories were created alongside it.
- The `tests/` directory had no `__init__.py` — kept that way (rootdir-relative imports work correctly without it given the conftest.py path insertion).
- Frontend `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` could not be run: the `frontend/` directory has no `package.json` or node_modules. The TypeScript source file and test file were created; a full Next.js scaffold is required before those commands can execute. This is noted as an open item.

**Open questions for Steph:**

- Should the frontend scaffold (Next.js, Vitest config, ESLint config, `package.json`) be set up as a separate spec, or will you scaffold it manually?
- Should the dev router be conditionally excluded in production via an ENV flag? The current implementation always registers it.

**No new ADRs written** — all decisions were straightforward implementations of the spec.

## Notes for implementer

- The route is a dev/test endpoint. Add a comment in the route file and in `main.py` making this explicit. Do not add it to any OpenAPI tags that would surface it in user-facing docs.
- `backend/lib/` must not import from FastAPI. The `reverse_string` function must remain importable in isolation (pure logic only).
- Unicode codepoint reversal is the Python default — no special handling needed. Document this assumption in the function docstring so future maintainers don't accidentally "fix" it.
- TypeScript's `.split("").reverse().join("")` is also codepoint-level for the BMP; document the same assumption in a JSDoc comment.
